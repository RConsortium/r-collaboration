# Open Data Registry 

## About
This registry exists to help people discover and share datasets that are available via various resources that the R community can leverage in their code and analytics. The R Consortium is exploring more ways to support an open data registry, and facilitate global collaboration.

The goal of this registry is to expand access to useful data available to the global R community. With that in mind, we prefer to list datasets that are clearly documented, are actively supported, can be used for research or educational purposes, and are optimized for analysis using R tools. Datasets are included at the discretion of the contributor, however, the R Consortium ISC and staff may remove datasets from the registry at any time. Data providers are responsible for maintaining and supporting the data that are shared.

## Add to this registry
If you want to add a dataset or example of how to use a dataset to this registry, please follow the [instructions](instructions.md).

Unless specifically stated in the applicable dataset documentation, datasets available through the this registry are not provided and maintained by the R Consortium unless expressly stated. Datasets are provided and maintained by a variety of third parties under a variety of licenses. Please check dataset licenses and related documentation to determine if a dataset may be used for your application.
