## Abstract
The following dashboard shows the global spread of COVID-19, where the information for the different countries is exposed together with relevant statistics. Finally, a predictive model of machine learning for the city of Hubei was developed.

## Full Description
The dashboard is a tool that presents the propagation of COVID-19 in the world, for this the confirmed cases, deaths and recovered both in a disaggregated form by country and accumulated are exposed. Together with this a machine learning model was developed which seeks Predict confirmed cases as deaths. Preliminary results show novel results with a low percentage error for each model of 1.13% and 3.19% for models of confirmed cases and deaths. It should be noted that time series were used since 22 January to March 4 of the city of Hubei. Finally, I am working on new visualization modules as well as predictive for the dashboard.
